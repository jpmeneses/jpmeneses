- 👋 Hi, I’m Juan Pablo Meneses. I'm a PhD student at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC), and I'm also a researcher at PUC's Biomedical Imaging Center.
- 👀 My research area is related to fat quantifaction techniques using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about image translation DL methods and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any MRI application in which physics-based DL approaches could be useful.
- 📫 How to reach me: My e-mail address is jpmeneses@uc.cl
